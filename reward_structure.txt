Two separate reward systems:
	Turn by turn reward system: one based on the immediate game that you're in (first layer)
	Game by game reward system: one based on the historical games that you have already played (second layer)

Turn by turn reward system:
	1) reward for legal move
	2) negative reward for illegal move
		-Noted by print statements "You can't play that.", "You have already played a land for turn."
	3) reward for playing land in main phase
	4) reward for spells targeting other player's creatures or life
	5) negative reward for spells targeting your own creatures or life
	6) reward for playing a creature
	7) reward for attacking (bigger)
	8) reward for blocking (bigger)
	9) negative reward for losing life
	10) negative reward for losing creature (smaller)

Game by game reward system:
	We need to keep track of the moves that the AI made: which ones worked, and which ones didn't work.
	
	1) Ending number of points from turn by turn reward system.
		- Positive (good)
		- Negative (bad)
	2) Reward for winning the game.
		- More likely to adopt the strategy used in this game.
	3) Negative reward for losing the game.
		- Less likely to adopt the strategy used in this game.

Initial State:

Draw 7 cards, Field is empty, life totals are 20

Game Phase 1: Player plays a card - Spell, Land, or Creature

Possibility: Simplify board state to focus on just number of creatures

20x20x8

what if we simplify creatures (P1 to P2) as the difference between number of creatures? 40x8

Slideling scale from -20 to 20: Reward based on how this number has changed

Function scans battle field for creatures (both tapped and untapped), keeps track of difference between P1 and P2 creatures

Every time P1 has advantage (positive #), P1 attack

Life total Ranges? 20-10 ok with above strat - Swing out
10-5 play safe - Swing with only the difference
5 and below defensive (only safe strategy if P2 is tapped out (All creatures on P2 creatures are tapped) and P1 creatures > P2 creatures)

Epsilon/(len of other probs) = .05/(len other probs in choices)

Q-Table big?

Phase 1: Basically above, update at end of every choice (this phase cycles until pass)

Phase 2: Look at life instead, learn to look at that difference to decide on # to swing?
When would Phase 2 probs update? When P2 goes to attack, how many blockers were there? Negative for not enough blocks, positive for having blocks

Phase 3: Blocks
